            <h2>Why Homework Can Be Harmful</h2>
            <p>
                Homework is often seen as a necessary part of learning, yet research
                suggests that excessive assignments can diminish students'
                enthusiasm for education. When children spend hours on homework
                after a full day of school, they have little time left for play,
                exploration and much-needed rest.
            </p>
            <p>
                Studies show that too much homework can lead to stress and burnout.
                Instead of deepening understanding, students may end up completing
                tasks simply to get them done. Over time, this can foster negative
                feelings toward learning and reduce creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, lengthy assignments can widen the achievement gap,
                disproportionately affecting students who lack a quiet place or
                support at home. Teachers can encourage balance by focusing on
                meaningful, concise tasks that reinforce classroom lessons without
                overwhelming learners.
            </p>
            <p>
                By rethinking the role of homework, we can promote well-being and
                ignite students' natural curiosity. When they have time to pursue
                hobbies, interact with family and recharge, kids come to class
                ready to engage and grow.
